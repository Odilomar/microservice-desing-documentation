# Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the deployment process for the microservice using Kubernetes. It includes key manifest files, scalability strategies, and an explanation of how the service scales dynamically.

## 2. Key Kubernetes Components

### 2.1. Deployment
Defines how the microservice is deployed and managed.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: microservice-deployment
  labels:
    app: microservice
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: microservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: microservice
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: microservice
          image: myrepo/microservice:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: microservice-config
```

### 2.2. Service
Exposes the microservice to other services or the internet.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: microservice-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: microservice
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### 2.3. ConfigMap
Stores environment variables separately from application code.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: microservice-config
  labels:
    app: microservice
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:password@db:5432/microservice"
  CACHE_HOST: "redis"
```

## 3. Scalability Strategy

### 3.1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
Ensures the deployment scales based on CPU usage.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: microservice-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: microservice-deployment
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

### 3.2. Load Balancing
- Uses Kubernetes **LoadBalancer** service to distribute traffic across multiple pods.
- External requests are routed through an **Ingress Controller** for better traffic management.

### 3.3. Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring CPU, memory, and request rates.
- **Fluentd** for centralized log aggregation.

## 4. Conclusion
This deployment strategy ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The use of **HPA**, **load balancing**, and **monitoring tools** guarantees the microservice adapts dynamically to varying traffic loads.
