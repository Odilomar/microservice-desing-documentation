# Testing Strategy for Microservice

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the microservice, ensuring its reliability, performance, and maintainability. The strategy includes unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing to cover critical functionalities.

## 2. Testing Approach

### 2.1. Unit Testing
**Objective:** Ensure individual components work as expected.

**Scope:**
- Input validation (e.g., ensuring required fields are present, proper data types).
- Business logic (e.g., correct handling of CRUD operations).
- Database persistence (e.g., verifying data is stored and retrieved correctly).
- Error handling (e.g., testing how the service handles invalid inputs).

**Tools & Frameworks:**
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing.
- Supertest for API endpoint testing.

**Example Test Case:**
```typescript
import request from 'supertest';
import { app } from '../src/app';

describe('POST /data', () => {
  it('should return 400 if required fields are missing', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/data')
      .send({ name: 'Test Item' });
    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

### 2.2. Test Coverage Goals
- **Critical paths** must have at least 90% coverage.
- All **business logic** must be unit tested.
- All **API endpoints** must have functional tests.
- **Error handling cases** should be covered to ensure robustness.

### 2.3. Integration Testing
**Objective:** Ensure proper interaction between components.

**Scope:**
- API and database interaction.
- Service layer correctness.
- External dependencies (e.g., Redis caching).

**Tools:**
- Jest with in-memory PostgreSQL for database tests.
- Dockerized test environments for realistic simulations.

### 2.4. Performance Testing
**Objective:** Ensure scalability and response time requirements are met.

**Scope:**
- API response time under 500ms under normal load.
- Load testing for concurrent requests.

**Tools:**
- K6 for load testing.
- Artillery for stress testing.

**Example Load Test:**
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://localhost:3000/data');
  check(res, { 'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500 });
}
```

### 2.5. Future Enhancements
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline.
- Implement contract testing with Pact.
- Introduce end-to-end (E2E) testing with Cypress for UI integrations.

## 3. Conclusion
This testing strategy ensures the microservice maintains high quality by covering unit, integration, and performance tests, with clear goals for test coverage and future improvements.
